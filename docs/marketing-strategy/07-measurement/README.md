# Measurement & Analytics

> Track what matters, review regularly, adjust based on data.

## Philosophy

Effective measurement is not about tracking everything - it is about tracking the right things and taking action on what you learn. For Pike & West, this means:

1. **Business outcomes first** - Revenue and bookings are the ultimate measures of success
2. **Leading indicators second** - Website traffic, inquiries, and engagement predict future bookings
3. **Regular review cadence** - Weekly quick checks, monthly deep dives
4. **Data-informed decisions** - Use metrics to guide strategy, not justify assumptions

## Measurement Framework

### Hierarchy of Metrics

```text
                    Revenue
                       |
                   Bookings
                       |
                 Tour Requests
                       |
              Website Inquiries
                       |
    ----------------------------------------
    |              |              |         |
  Organic      Social Media     Email     Referral
  Traffic       Traffic       Traffic    Traffic
```

Every marketing activity should ultimately ladder up to revenue. If a metric does not connect to business outcomes, question whether it is worth tracking.

## Key Principles

### Track Trends, Not Snapshots

A single data point means nothing. Track metrics over time to identify:

- Seasonal patterns
- Growth trajectories
- Impact of specific campaigns

### Attribution Is Imperfect

Couples research venues across many touchpoints over months. Accept that:

- Not every booking can be perfectly attributed
- Multi-touch attribution matters more than last-click
- Ask "How did you hear about us?" on every inquiry

### Quality Over Quantity

Focus on metrics that indicate quality engagement:

- Time on site over pageviews
- Inquiry-to-booking rate over total inquiries
- Engagement rate over follower count

### Act on Insights

Data without action is just numbers. Every review should end with:

- Specific actions to take
- Experiments to run
- Strategies to adjust
