### Tier 1: High-Intent Local Keywords

**Goal:** Capture people ready to book a venue

These searchers have decided they need a venue and are actively comparing options. They convert at the highest rates.

| Keyword Pattern             | Example                          | Monthly Volume | Competition |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| [event] venue Germantown    | wedding venue Germantown         | 50-100         | Medium      |
| event space [location] TN   | event space Memphis TN           | 200-500        | High        |
| small wedding venue Memphis | -                                | 100-200        | Medium      |
| private party venue [area]  | private party venue Collierville | 20-50          | Low         |

**Content Strategy:** Homepage, dedicated landing pages per event type

### Tier 2: Consideration Keywords

**Goal:** Reach people comparing options and venues

These searchers are researching but haven't committed. They need compelling content to move down the funnel.

| Keyword Pattern                   | Example                             | Intent Signal           |

**Content Strategy:** Blog posts, comparison guides, venue feature pages
