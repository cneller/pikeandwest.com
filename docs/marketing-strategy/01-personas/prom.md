## 4. Pain Points & Challenges

### External Challenges

- Competition for popular dates (all proms same weekend)
- Coordinating with other families for group photos
- Weather uncertainty for outdoor options
- Budget already stretched by dress, hair, makeup, limo, tickets
- Finding available photographers

### Internal Challenges

- Pressure to deliver something special on short notice
- Fear of choosing wrong location and regretting it
- Stress of coordinating with multiple other parents
- Worry about looking "cheap" compared to other families
- Anxiety about weather or logistics ruining photos

### Objections (Why She Might NOT Book)

- "Is it worth paying for just photos? We could do a park."
- "How much time do we actually get?"
- "Will it be crowded with other prom groups?"
- "Can we bring our whole group (10+ kids plus parents)?"
- "I just found out about prom - is there any availability?"

### Past Bad Experiences

- Photos in front of house that looked boring
- Park photos interrupted by public/weather
- Hotel lobby photos that security rushed
- Location that was crowded with other prom groups
- Backdrop that didn't match the elegant dress
