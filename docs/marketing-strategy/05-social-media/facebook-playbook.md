Congratulations to the Johnson family on a stunning 50th anniversary celebration!

After 50 years of marriage, the Johnsons chose Pike & West to celebrate this incredible milestone with over 100 of their closest family and friends. The evening featured elegant gold and ivory decor, live jazz music, and a beautiful tribute video created by their grandchildren.

We were honored to be part of such a meaningful celebration of lasting love. These are the moments that make what we do so rewarding.
