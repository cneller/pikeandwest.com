## Issues Found

### CRITICAL: Default OG Image Path Mismatch

**Configuration in `config/_default/params.toml`:**

```toml
defaultOgImage = "/images/og-default.jpg"
```

**Actual file location:**

```text
static/images/photos/og-default.jpg
```

**Result:** Pages without a specified `image` parameter in front matter have NO og:image tag. The default fallback is configured but pointing to a non-existent path.

**Affected pages (key ones):**

- `/contact/` - High-traffic page, no social sharing image
- `/about/` - Brand page, no social sharing image
- `/workshops/` - Feature page, no social sharing image
- `/gallery-application/` - Artist application page, no social sharing image
- `/privacy/` - Legal page (low priority)
- `/accessibility/` - Legal page (low priority)

**Full list of affected pages:** 85 total (many are pagination pages like `/tags/*/page/1/` which are low priority)

**Fix options:**

1. Move file: `mv static/images/photos/og-default.jpg static/images/og-default.jpg`
2. Update config: Change `defaultOgImage = "/images/photos/og-default.jpg"`
3. Add images to content files: Update front matter for key pages

**Recommended fix:** Option 2 (update config) - least disruptive, maintains existing file organization.

### WARNING: Twitter Card Without Image

Pages missing `og:image` also lack `twitter:image`, but still declare `twitter:card: summary_large_image`. This may cause Twitter to show a blank or placeholder card.

## Validator Simulation

Since external validators (Facebook Sharing Debugger, Twitter Card Validator, LinkedIn Post Inspector) cannot be accessed programmatically, here's what each would report based on the tags present:

### Facebook Sharing Debugger

**Homepage:** Would pass all checks. Image loads, dimensions acceptable (Facebook handles cropping), all required OG tags present.

**Blog post:** Would pass all checks. Article metadata parsed correctly, featured image displays properly.

**Contact page:** Would fail image validation. Title and description present but no og:image to display.

### Twitter Card Validator

**Homepage:** Would render as summary_large_image card with venue photo, title, and description.

**Blog post:** Would render as summary_large_image card with hero image and article details.

**Contact page:** Would render as summary card (fallback from summary_large_image due to missing image) with just title/description.

### LinkedIn Post Inspector

**Homepage:** Would display rich preview with image and metadata.

**Blog post:** Would display article preview with featured image.

**Contact page:** Would display text-only preview (no image available).

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Update `config/_default/params.toml` to fix default OG image path:

   ```toml
   defaultOgImage = "/images/photos/og-default.jpg"
   ```

2. **Short-term:** Add `image` and `image_alt` to front matter for key pages:
   - `/contact/`
   - `/about/`
   - `/workshops/`

3. **Low priority:** Consider adding images to category/tag taxonomy pages for better social sharing when users share category URLs.

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check homepage OG tags
grep -E 'og:image|twitter:image' public/index.html

# Check blog post OG tags
grep -E 'og:image|article:' public/blog/milestone-birthday-new-year/index.html

# Find pages missing og:image
find public -name "index.html" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -L "og:image" | wc -l

# Verify image exists and dimensions
sips -g pixelHeight -g pixelWidth static/images/homepage-hero/venue-exterior.jpg
```
