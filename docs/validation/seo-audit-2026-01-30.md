# SEO Validation Audit Results - 2026-01-30

## Summary

| Category       | Status | Notes                                      |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|
| Meta Tags      | PASS   | All pages have description and OG tags     |
| Canonical URLs | PASS   | All point to production domain (after fix) |
| JSON-LD        | PASS   | Valid schemas on all pages                 |
| Twitter Cards  | PASS   | Large image cards configured               |

## Issue Found and Fixed

**Issue:** The workshops page (`/workshops/`) had a relative canonical URL in front matter.

- **Before:** `canonical: "/workshops/"`
- **After:** `canonical: "https://pikeandwest.com/workshops/"`
- **File:** `content/workshops.md` line 16

This was the only page with a custom canonical override. All other pages use Hugo's `.Permalink` which correctly outputs absolute URLs.

## Notes for Google Rich Results Test

The JSON-LD schemas follow Google's structured data guidelines:

- **Organization:** Includes required `name`, `url`, `logo` with dimensions
- **EventVenue:** Includes `name`, `address`, `geo`, `priceRange`
- **BlogPosting:** Includes `headline`, `datePublished`, `author`, `publisher`, `image`
- **BreadcrumbList:** Proper `itemListElement` with `position` and `item`

When testing with Google's Rich Results Test:

1. Organization and EventVenue schemas should be detected on homepage
2. BlogPosting schema should be detected on blog posts
3. Breadcrumb rich results may be eligible on blog posts

## Recommendations

1. **Consider adding FAQ schema** to event pages if they have frequently asked questions
2. **Add ImageGallery schema** to gallery pages when implemented
3. **Monitor in Search Console** for any structured data warnings after indexing
